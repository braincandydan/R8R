# API Status - R8R App

## Google Places API - DISABLED ❌

**Status:** Disabled to avoid costs  
**Date:** Current  
**Reason:** Cost management

### What's Working Instead:
- ✅ **Mock/Seed Locations**: Local restaurants in `lib/data/seed_locations.dart`
- ✅ **User-Submitted Locations**: Firebase Firestore (no API costs)
- ✅ **Location Services**: GPS for user location (free)
- ✅ **Add Location Feature**: Users can add new restaurants
- ✅ **Search & Filter**: Works with existing data

### Current Data Sources:
1. **Seed Data** (`lib/data/seed_locations.dart`)
   - Customizable local restaurants
   - No API costs
   - Instant loading

2. **User-Generated Content** (Firebase Firestore)
   - Community-added locations
   - No external API costs
   - Real-time updates

### To Re-enable Google Places API (if needed):
1. Get Google Places API key
2. Add to `lib/services/places_service.dart`
3. Set `_useRealData = true` in `LocationService`
4. Update environment variables

### Cost Savings:
- Google Places API: $0/month (disabled)
- Firebase Firestore: Free tier (generous limits)
- Total API costs: $0/month

### User Experience:
- Users can still find and rate locations
- Community can add new restaurants
- No degradation in core functionality
- Actually faster loading (no API delays)
