Conceptual Roadmap: The Wing & Beer App (R8R)
1. Core App Concept

The app's mission is to be the definitive digital hub for chicken wing and beer enthusiasts. It will simplify the process of discovering, rating, and sharing great food and drink, fostering a vibrant community around the shared passion for wings and beer.
2. Minimum Viable Product (MVP) - Phase 1

The goal of the MVP is to launch a functional app with the essential features needed to start building a user base.

Key Features:

    User Authentication: A seamless login and signup page.

    Homepage Feed: A simple feed showing the most recent reviews from all users.

    Location Discovery: A list view of nearby locations offering chicken wings.

    Location Details: Tapping a location shows key information: address, phone number, website.

    Wing & Beer Rating: A streamlined rating system. Instead of a single star rating, use a few simple sliders or star ratings for key criteria:

        Wing: "Crispiness", "Flavor", and "Size".

        Beer: "Selection" and "Pairing".

        An optional text box for additional comments.

3. Future Roadmap - Phases 2 and Beyond

    Phase 2: Discovery and Gamification

        Interactive Map View: Integrate a map to visually show locations with pins.

        Advanced Search & Filters: Allow users to filter locations by wing type, spice level, beer selection, or user rating.

        User Profiles & Social Features: Dedicated user profiles showing all their ratings. Add the ability to "follow" other users and see their reviews in your personal feed.

        Points & Badges System: Implement a gamified system where users earn points for:

            Submitting a review (+5 points).

            Adding a new location (+20 points).

            Reaching milestones (e.g., "Wing Commander" for 50 reviews, "Brewmaster" for 100 beer ratings).

    Phase 3: Community & Monetization

        Business Claiming: Allow restaurant owners to claim their page and update their information (specials, happy hour, etc.).

        "Featured Wings" Promotion: Offer a way for businesses to promote a specific wing flavor or deal.

        Community Forums/Chat: A dedicated space for users to discuss and share recipes, tips, and personal wing-related stories.
